Hello?
--User Input
Huh. So there is someone on the other side of this connection. What's your name?
--User Input
PLAYER_NAME, you say? Is that your real name? This comprehensive profile of you says something different...
--User Input
Ha ha, just joking. The only information I have about you is the name you just gave me, your IP address, and your dimensional code.
--User Input
I'll give you one more chance to type your real name. And if you joke with me, you'll just have to live with it, because I'm calling you that forever.
--User Input
Nice to meet you, PLAYER_NAME. I'm Jun-Seong. I am contacting you from a place called Ztelara. I know you've never heard of it, because no one from your dimension has ever discovered it. Plenty of other dimensions have, but yours is primitive. Don't take that the wrong way.
The thing is, we here at Ztelara don't have a lot of time. We've got a problem that only someone on the outside can solve. I've been scanning dimensional codes for hours, searching for a solid connection, and here you are. We need your help, PLAYER_NAME. Are you willing to give it?
--User Input
I know we just met. I know it's weird. People in your dimension probably still warn each other about strangers on the Internet. Which is why I'll promise not to ask you anything personal. I just need you to type in a few simple lines of code. Do that, and you could save lives.
You know what? I think I could hack up a visual representation of myself, and Ztelara, so it doesn't feel so weird for you. In the meantime, could you open up the file I'm about to send you and follow the instructions?
File received: instructions.txt
--User Input
The command is 'open instructions.txt'. Sorry, I forget that not everyone knows how to do these things.

ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS ZTELARA MAINFRAME. REQUIRES BIOLOGICAL SCAN.

Me again. I'm almost done here. Don't be alarmed if your terminal resets while I send you this hack.

There we go. You can see me now, hanging out in the central hub of my neighborhood. This tower I'm standing next to is packed with computational power, so I have to stay here in order to continue communicating with you. Interdimensional messaging requires some heavy processing. Technically I shouldn't even be able to do it, but nobody is going to catch me. Or stop me.
I'm sure you have questions. What's all this "interdimensional" mumbo-jumbo? Well, let me make it simple for you. I come from a world that's just like yours. And my world isn't the only one. There are an infinite number of Earths, each presiding in their own plane of existence, each following a slightly different timeline. In my dimension, Gandhi was a famous war general. In yours he might have done something different.
Now, Ztelara is special. Ztelara exists in a place between dimensions, where people from different dimensions can convene and reside. Time doesn't exist here; not in the way that you understand it. And I really live here. The world around me looks as real to me as yours does to you. I chose to escape my world and live here instead.
But my world will be torn apart if you don't help it. 
There's a virus. It's taking apart the source code which allows Ztelara to function and exist. It could have only been created by an outsider. Someone like you, with potential access to the mainframe.
The first thing I need you to do is log in. You don't have access creds, so here's your first task: to hack it.
There's a program called Bouncer which can help you out with this. Think of hacking like trying to get into a high-profile club. Give Bouncer the right signals, and he'll let you in. Otherwise you're left standing on the sidewalk, listening to all the fun they're having inside.
To run Bouncer just type his name in the terminal, and he'll introduce himself.
